Step 1: Import Libraries
First, import the necessary libraries in Python, including scikit-learn, which provides the KNN 
algorithm implementation.
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


Step 2: Prepare the Data
Load your dataset and split it into input features (X) and corresponding class labels (y).
# Assuming your data is stored in a pandas DataFrame called 'data'
X = data.drop('target', axis=1) # Features
y = data['target'] # Class labels

Step 3: Split the Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. This allows us to train the KNN algorithm on a 
portion of the data and evaluate its performance on the remaining unseen data.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


Step 4: Create and Train the KNN Model
Create an instance of the KNeighborsClassifier class and specify the desired value for K (the 
number of neighbors to consider). Then, train the model using the training data.
k = 5 # Number of neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)


Step 5: Make Predictions
Use the trained KNN model to make predictions on the test set.
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)


Step 6: Evaluate Accuracy
Compare the predicted class labels (y_pred) with the true class labels (y_test) to evaluate 
the accuracy of the KNN model.
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
